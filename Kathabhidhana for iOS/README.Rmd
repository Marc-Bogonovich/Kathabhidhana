Kathabhidhana for iOS : Audio recording for Odia Wikitionary
===================================
<i>This is a guide to recording words for Odia Wikitionary in an iOS environment using an iOS app called <b>Workflow</b> along with the online automation service [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/).</i>

[Workflow](https://workflow.is) is an iOS app that allows building complex automations through a visual interface.

The Kathabhidhana workflow allows recording multiple words from a wordlist one-by-one using the Workflow app. You can download the <b>.wflow</b> file in this repo or from the [official directory](https://workflow.is/workflows/acb7f3c267754b2ca84839d68fb52eef). It can record words at an average speed of 5 wpm.

<i>While a better mic is always preferrable, the inbuilt mic on an Apple device is good enough. The audio files can then be cleaned using an audio-editing program, such as the open-source [Audacity](http://www.audacityteam.org/). Also, supported microphones can send their input directly to iOS, such as the [Blue Yeti](http://www.bluemic.com/products/yeti/). You may want to look into such products to get a more professional recording.</i>

 
How to execute
-----
1. Ensure that you have the Workflow app installed. Download the <i>Kathabhidhana for iOS</i> workflow from the above links.
2. Run the Kathabhidhana workflow inside the app.
3. The workflow will prompt you to enter the wordlist that is to be recorded. 
4. Once done, the workflow prompts you to record the first word. The word is displayed in a native iOS notification. Tap once to start recording and tap again to stop the recording. 
5. The recording is played back to you instantly. You can directly export the audio file or re-record it if it does not sound right. 
6. The recording is exported to a document provider with the specified metadata. Each time you record a new word, a new record is added to the specified Google Sheet using IFTTT, containing the details of each file.

Extra Information
-----
- You can type the list of words in the text entry field. If you had copied a selection from a previously existing wordlist, it will be automatically added to the text field from the clipboard. (You can delete the clipboard text if you want)
- Each word in the wordlist must be distinguished by using some special character like a hyphen or a newline. The default is set to a newline so that the algorithm splits them up line-by-line. You can change it to any custom character.
- You can also set a fixed time for each recording so that it is automatically stopped after the given duration elapses.
- With Split View on iOS, you can keep a document provider open side-by-side the Workflow app to export files continuously without jumping between apps too many times.
- You can change the naming pattern in the 'Rename' block.
- For the IFTTT integration, you need to grant workflow access to your IFTTT account and create a custom applet.
