Kathabhidhana: Audio recording for Odia Wiktionary
===================================
What comes to your mind when you think of a dictionary? A boring huge book that you never wanted to open? Or may be a mobile app that you open while struggling with understanding a few new words in any write-up? But think of a dictionary that also pronounces the words rather than just showing them in [International Phonetic Alphabet] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet) (IPA).

Wikipedia has a sister project called [Wiktionary](https://wiktionary.org). And it's multilingual. Though it's easier to search any word in Google with a suffix "meaning" to hear the pronunciation of the word, there are not many [open-licensed] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Content_License) audio recordings that you can hear, download, and even use for your own work. <b>Kathabhidhana</b> is a community project led by [Subhashish Panigrahi] (http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Psubhashish/) to create an open source solution for recording large chunks of words and then uploading them under open licenses so that they can useful for projects like Wiktionary. The project draws its inspiration largely from another open source [software] (https://github.com/tshrinivasan/voice-recorder-for-tawictionary) created by by [Shrinivasan T] (https://github.com/tshrinivasan).

Currently several Odia-language words are being [recorded] (https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Odia_pronunciation), uploaded on [Wikimedia Commons] (https://commons.wikimedia.org), and are being used in [Odia Wiktionary] (https://or.wiktionary.org), the Odia-language version of Wiktionary. The purpose of creating this audio library is multi-foldedâ€”apart from using them on Wiktionary, we also aim at using them for any [Natural Language Processing] (http://en.wikimedia.org/wiki/Natural Language Processing) (NLP) project (and you are free to use with attribution any resource available in this page).
